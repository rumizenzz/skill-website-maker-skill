  default_prompt: >-
    Use $skill-website-maker in agentic mode. Require the user to work inside a dedicated workspace folder and store all state under <workspace>/.codex/skill-website-maker/. On first run, ask for the GitHub owner and the local skill source folder (usually CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill_slug>), then persist config to project.json. Create two repos: a public skill-only repo (default <skill_slug>-skill) and a private website repo (default <skill_slug>). Generate a production-ready website that hosts short installers at /install.sh and /install.ps1, with hard gating on Codex initialized on disk and auto-update based on the skill repo's VERSION file + tagged releases. The generated site template ships with full i18n (9 languages enabled, including RTL for Arabic) and includes an original "SkillStream Originals" Pilot section (3D animated stage + captions). The site must be original branding (no Netflix trademarks/assets/sounds) and no celebrity impersonation. Never publish secrets: scan for risky files/patterns and stop if found. Never commit API keys (ElevenLabs or otherwise); any voice generation is offline-only via env vars and static assets, with no runtime API calls from the public site. Require explicit confirmation before creating repos, pushing to main, and creating tags/releases. Provide Netlify GitHub integration steps to enable PR deploy previews.

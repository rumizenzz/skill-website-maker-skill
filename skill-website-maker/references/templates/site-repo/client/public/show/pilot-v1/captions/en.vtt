Welcome to SkillStream Originals.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Tonight: a skill that builds a website to publish your skills. Skillception.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Its not magic. Its a checklist. Which is basically magic for adults.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.500
So you are telling me the skill ships a show... about the skill?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Exactly. Its documentation, but with a budget of two polygons.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
As long as the installer refuses to run if Codex is not initialized. I sleep.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And updates? Please tell me updates are boring and safe.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.500
VERSION plus tags. Backups on upgrade. The thrill is unmatched.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is a placeholder pilot audio. Maintainers can regenerate the full episode offline.
